# Python Git Clone

## codecrafters

Check out the awesome [codecrafters](https://codecrafters.io).

## Usage
This solely uses the Python standard library, so there are no dependancies but Python 3.x. To try it out:
```
git clone https://github.com/chammaaomar/make-your-own-git.git
cd make-your-own-git
./your_git.sh -h
```

will display the commands that have been implemented thus far with (hopefully) helpful usage messages. The commands are

- `init`
- `cat-file`. Currently only works with blob objects.
- `hash-object`. Currently only works with blob objects.

Currently adding support for trees.
